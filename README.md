# Commonly asked problems in interviews 

## ril_game_of_coordinates:
You are given the coordinates (x, y). Initially, you are at (1, 1) and are
required to go to (x, y) using the following rules: If the current position
is (a, b) then in the next move you could only move to (a+b, b) or (a, a+b).
Write a program to check if you can reach (x, y) using only the moves
described above.
